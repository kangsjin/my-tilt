![logo](/assets/images/mytilt-logo.png)

myTilt is a service that connects people looking for rooms with those offering rooms in Germany.

## Features

- Search for rooms available in Germany.
- Connect with people who are offering rooms.
- Bookmark rooms you're interested in (coming soon).
- View locations on a map for easy navigation(coming soon).

## Why `Tilt`?

Why is it called `MyTilt`, you ask? German windows are known for their unique tilt function. Anyone living in Germany is familiar with it. This is where the inspiration for the name MyTilt came from. 'MyRoom' or 'MyHouse' felt a bit boring, don't you think? üòÖ

## Why I built it?

This project initially started as a personal study project to learn `Next.js`. However, as I continued building it, the project reached a level of completeness that might even lead to it becoming an actual service. (maybe)

## Running the project

If you're familiar with Next.js, you can quickly start the development server by running `npm run dev`. However, to ensure everything works correctly, you'll need to set up a .env file with the following values:

```
MONGODB_URI=
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3000/api
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_URL_INTERNAL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY=
```
